       //if we create instance variable it will be stored in heap
         //if we create local variable it will be stored in stack
         //if we create static variable it will be stored in heap
//in main method we can create local variable 
//new method create new stack how many time we call new method it will create new stack
//in main stack we can create multiple stack
//for every object we can create in heap  
//for every object has method declaration which have only method definition but actual area in stack 
//for every object has address in heap 
//and that address is stored in reference variable
//heap is data structure which is used to store data in form of object and object is a collection of data and method
//heap is expandable
//stack is not expandable
//stack is data structure which is used to store data in form of local variable
