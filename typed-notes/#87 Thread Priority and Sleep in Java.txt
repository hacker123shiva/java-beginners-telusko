In this lecture we will learn:
- Thread priority in Java
- How we can suggest a priority for a thread?
- Sleep() method in thread
- Waiting state in a thread


#1
- We cannot control the schedular, we can only give suggestions to it to give priority.
- getPriority() is a method that gives the current priority of a thread.
- The range of priority goes from 1 to 10. One is the least priority whereas ten is the maximum priority.
- 5 is the default priority or normal priority. By default, every thread has a normal priority which is 5.
- We can also change the priority by using the setPriority().
- Different schedulers have different algorithms to work upon so by giving priority, we can only give suggestions to it. 
- It might be possible that the scheduler gives the highest priority to the process that will execute in less time at the running phase.

#2
- We can also make a thread to wait for some time and then execute the statement further.
- Thread will wait by using the sleep() method.
- In the sleep() method, we have the pass value for how much time we want a thread to wait. The time will be in milliseconds.
- Sleep() method will throw an interrupted exception. So, we can handle an exception by using the try-catch block.
- When we use sleep(), then the thread goes into the waiting state.

-> As a programmer, we can not control a thread, we can only optimise it.
