1) datatypes for given variable
  a)Types of data-types?
  b)primitive data types
  c)why do we need different type of integer type?
  d)how to create variable of different data types?

2) range and way to declare different data variable

a) Datatypes are categories into primitive and non-primitive datatype.
But in this lecture, we are take all concept upon primitive data type.

b) There are 8 primitive datatype
integer ---byte, short, int, long
float --- float , double 
character ---char 
boolean --- boolean 

c) why do we need different type of integer ?
=> there are range for each type. for int --4 bytes ,long --8 bytes, short --2bytes byte --1byte

d) How to create variable of different data type?
=> int a=10; byte b=4
=> dataType <variableName> = value;

integer variable declaration
int a=5;
long b=600l; // e.g 578l, 100000l represent long integer type
byte c=127;
short s=128; 

float vs double 
=>double have more precision than float by default java support double.
=>declare variable of float and double type
  -->double a=5.6;
  -->but float b=5.6; //give error 
  -->correct way float b=5.6f;

character representation 
=> char ch='a'; //using single quotes on character we can declare char type of variable

boolean representation of variable
=> boolean result=true; there are only two value of boolean either true or false.
=>In other language like c and c++ --> 0 is treated as false and non zero number treated as true but it is not in java.

{byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, Boolean }
since java is statically type or say strongly type language therefore we need 
to mention datatype for each variable for declaring variable.
e.g int i=5; float f=2.5f; 

In java integer are by default for integer int type;
for real number by default double

Range and way to declare different data type variable
        int i=5;// 4 bytes --->32 bytes  --> -2147483648 to 2147483647
        short s=5;//2 bytes --> 16 bytes -->-32768 to 32767
        byte b=5;//1 byte --> 8 bytes --> -128 to 127
        long l=5;//8 bytes --> 64 bytes --> -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807
        float f=5.5f;//4 bytes --> 32 bytes --> 1.4e-45 to 3.4028235e+38
        double d=5.5;//8 bytes --> 64 bytes --> 4.9e-324 to 1.7976931348623157e+308
        char c='a';//2 bytes --> 16 bytes --> 0 to 65535
        boolean check=true; //value is either true or false
