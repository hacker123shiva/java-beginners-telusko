In this video we are talking about final keyword:
-- final keyword use with variable , methods and class
-- if make a variable final then variable become constant
final int a=5;
//you cannot reassign a value to a
-- final class 
class A{
public void show(){
System.out.println("In Calc show);
}

public void add(int a,int b){
    System.out.println(a+b);
}
}

Suppose someone want to extend your class , but we want to stop inheritance then we need to make final
-- if you make class final then no one can inherite your class
-- but you can use the final class by making object of final class

class A{
    public final void show(){
        System.out.print("IN A");
    }
}

class B extends A{
    // but you inherit class but you cannot override show() method  if your method is final
    //since show method is final
}

-- if you make method as final no one can override your method.
