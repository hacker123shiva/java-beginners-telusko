In this lecture we will learn:
- What is an inner class in Java?
- Static inner classes in Java
- Advantages Of inner class


#1
Inner Class:-
- We can also create a class inside another class.
	class A
	{	
		class B
		{
		}
	}
- You can call the method of class B by using the dot operator in between both classes A and B.
	A.B obj= new B();
-  A dollar sign will be introduced in a class name that has an inner class indicating two different classes.
	A$B. class
- You also need to create an object of the outer class, to call the methods of an inner class.

#2
Static Inner Class:-
- An inner class can also be declared as static.
- When an inner class is declared as static, then you do not need to create an object for it.
- But an outer class can not be made static.

#3
Advantage of inner class:-
- Nested classes represent a particular type of relationship that is it can access all the members of the outer class, including private.
- Nested classes make the code more readable and maintainable.
- It makes the code more optimize.
