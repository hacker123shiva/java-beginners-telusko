In this lecture we will learn:
- Use of enum with if-else statements
- Use of enum with switch


- We can compare the status or values of an enum by using the if- else condition.
- Switch supports string, integer etc, and it also support enum.
- In switch() you need to pass an object reference variable as a parameter.
e.g.,	
enum Status{
	Running, Failed, Pending, Success;
}
if(s==Status.Running)
    		System.out.println("All Good");
    	else if(s==Status.Failed)
    		System.out.println("Try Again");
    	else if ( s==Status.Pending)
    		System.out.println("Please Wait");
    	else
    		System.out.println("Done");
    	

-  In switch case, we do not have to pass the object refernce variable again and again. We have to only pass the constant itself.
e.g.,	
Status s=Status.Pending;    	
    	switch(s)
    	{
    		case Running:
    			System.out.println("All Good");
    			break;
    			
    		case Failed:
    			System.out.println("Try Again");
    			break;
    			
    		case Pending:
    			System.out.println("Please Wait");
    			break;
    		
    		default:
    			System.out.println("Done");
    			break;
    	}
