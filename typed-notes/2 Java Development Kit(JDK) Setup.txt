In this lecture we are discussing about setup and tools required:

1)Editor/IDE
2)Compiler or interpreter 
3)Setup of jdk

#1
editor -It is a software which is used to write code
example- notepad, notepad++, sublime, visual studio code..

IDE - It is a software which is used to write code and compile and run the code .
example -eclipse ide, IntelliJ ide , visual studio
Note: With adding some extension vs code also work as IDE.

--> Visual studio and vs code both are different 
--> in this course we are follow vs code 

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft.
It is a cross-platform application that runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS. VS Code is built on the same underlying technology as Visual Studio,
but it is designed to be a more streamlined, lightweight development environment. 

link for vs code:https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
step to install:
i)select in which os you using windows, linux or macOS as per system download.
ii)just install and go next --> next -->next.
iii)Now it is ready to use

#2
Compiler and interpreter
-->You should download compiler and interpreter to compile or run the code.
-->for that we have toolkit jdk java development kit 

two option to download jdk :
a) with oracle 
b)open source like amazon cornetto 

setup and installation for oracle jdk:
link to download:https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

--> Select long term support version that is jdk 17 as per your operating system
-->after download just instal by clicking next -- next --next
-->Set path in environment variable

for that :
step 1:find--> c drive -- program files -- java -- jdk -- bin 
and copy this path  e.g c:\program files\java\jdk-17\bin 

step 2:open environment variable --> system variable or user variable -->path -- edit -- new -- paste the path of bin folder of jdk
Note: what is the difference between user and system variable?
user variable is only for that user  and system variable is for all user

step 3: save


open cmd or PowerShell :
write java --version and javac --version 
to check perfectly your compiler and jvm path setup
