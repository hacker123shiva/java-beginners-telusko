In this lecture we will learn:
- What is JVM?
- What is JDK?
- What is JRE?
- Importance and uses of JVM, JRE, and JDK.

#1
To compile the Java code, we need a tool and that tool is known as JDK ( Java Development Kit).
- Byte code runs on a machine so we have to convert the java code into the byte code.
- On installing the JDK, we get both updated JRE and JVM.

#2
JVM stands for Java Virtually Machine.
- JVM is the space where you execute the code.
- JVM is used to make the Java language a platform- independent.
- You have to compile the code through JDK and then run the code through JVM.
- JVM is platform dependent and it needs to be built for a particular OS.
- JVM is platform-dependent.

#3
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.
- JRE contains all the in-built classes and other extra files and libraries that we can use in our code.
- JRE validates the byte code.
- JRE loads a class.
- If you use extra libraries, and you also need an environment. An additional layer is present above the OS known as JRE.

#4
- JVM is a part of JRE. JRE includes JVM and libraries.
	JVM -> Java Virutal Machine
	JRE -> Java Runtime Environment
- For development purposes, you need to install JDK (Java Development Kit) which consists of JRE and JVM.
