In this lecture we will learn:
- Object creation in Java
- Anonymous objects in Java
- Difference between Simple objects and Anonymous objects


#1
In JVM, we have both stack memory and heap memory.
- Object is created in the heap memory that contains  variable and methods, it also have some address.
- A obj=new A();
  obj.show();
here, A is the classname.
         obj refers to the address say 101
	   show() is a method that is called using refernce vraiable obj.
- Every time you call an object, it will call the coonstructor as well.
- Object creation can be done in two ways:
	1. Declare an object  -> creating a reference
	2. Creating an object  -> and assigning the value to it
e,g., 	A obj;
		obj=new A();
	*new A() shows that you are creating an object.
- Reference of an object is created in the stack.


#2
Anonymous Objects:- 
Anonymous objects are simply created by using the new keyword.
- It does not have any refernce for an anonymous object.
e.g.,	new A();
- A method can directly be called using this object.
		new A().show();
- We can't use the same anonymous object again. It will be use only for one time.
