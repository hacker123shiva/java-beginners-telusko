In this lecture we will learn:
- Abstract and anonymous inner class
- Use of anonymous class with an abstract class
- Example of abstract and anonymous inner class.

#1
When you want to use an interface and an abstract class only once, then you can simply use an anonymous innner class in place of that.
- You can also provide the implementation for multiple methods in an anonymous inner class.
- Anonymous inner class can implement only one interface at s time.
- Anonymous inner class can either extend a class or implement an interface at a time.
- We can create object for abstract class by providing the implementation of an abstract method in an anonymous inner class.
e.g.,
abstract class A
{
	public abstract void show();
}

In main methid:
A obj=new A()
{
	public void shoe()
	{
		statement;
	}
};
