In this lecture we are discussing about array of objects:
-- If we create array by default value assign for each type of array
-- The new operator automatically initializes the elements of an array to their default value, which, for example, is zero for all numeric types
and null for all reference types.
-- why we should we know length of array using length property?
-- There is array out of bound exception.

How to create array of object and what does it means?
-- just like to create array for int, float, char we can create array of object 
-- when we we create array of object it means we create an array which can hold the reference of object.

e.g
class Student{

}

Student st=new Student();
we know st is reference and new Student() is object.
and st hold reference of student object.

similarly whenever we create array of object
Student sts[]=new Student[5];
it means we can create an array of Student reference type which can hold 5 different reference of
Student object.
sts[0]=new Student();
sts[1]=new Student();
sts[2]=new Student();
sts[3]=new Student();
sts[4]=new Student();
