In this lecture we will learn:
- forEach method in Java
- What is a consumer interface?
- Lambda expression with consumer object
- How forEach method works?


#1
- forEach method got introduced in Java 1.8 version.
- The forEach() method of ArrayList is used to perform a certain operation for each element in ArrayList.
- forEach traverses each element of the Iterable until all the elements have been processed.
- Collection classes that extend the Iterable interface can use forEach loop to iterate elements.

#2
- forEach method takes an object of the consumer.
- Consumer is an interface that belongs to the java.util.function package.
- Consumer is a functional interface so lambda expression will also be applicable to it.
- Consumer has a method accept(), that takes a value of the same type of which object is created.
e.g., 
	Consumer <Integer> con= new Consumer <Integer>() {
		public void accept (Integer n)
		{
			statements;
		}
	};

- forEach needs an object and we will pass an object of a consumer in it.
- forEach gives a value at a time and that value gets passed to the consumer object and taken by the accept method.
- We can do operations in this accept method.
