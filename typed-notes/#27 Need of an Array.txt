In this lecture we are discussing:
1)What is an Array ?
2)Why do we need array?
3)Simple variable declaration vs Array variable declaration

#1
-- An array is collection of similar type of data and store  in contagious memory.
-- e.g marks is collection of different marks obtained by 4 student then {24,25,26,27} is that marks then 
this marks store in contagious manner in memory.

#2
Why so we need array?
-- suppose we want to create five variable for student marks 
-- int m1=24; int m2=25; int m3=26; int m4=27; int m5=28;
-- it is quite tedious to store multiple value in multiple variable and remember the marks.
-- now one reason is that to create single variable which can store multiple value and access by its index.

#3
Simple variable declaration vs Array variable declaration
-- for creating normal variable
int num; boolean result=true;

-- for creating array variable 
int nums []; or int []nums; -- both are acceptable to declare array variable
