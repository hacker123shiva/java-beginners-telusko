In this lecture we will learn:
- Method in Java
- Use of methods in Java
- Main method in Java
- return type in methods
- Syntax of method

#1
A method in Java or Java Method is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return the result to the caller.
- Methods in Java allow us to reuse the code without retyping code.
- In Java, we create the components with the help of classes.
- Every class has a behavior and it is defined through the method.
- Behaviour or method is defined with the round brackets ().
- For every method, we also have to specify the type of access to it.
- Method does some tasks and it also returns something.
- We can call methods by creating an object.
- We can pass also pass values in a method.
- We can also put conditions inside the method like with the help of if..else.
- return keyword stops the execution of a method as it does not execute the further statements after it.

#2
--> void is used when we do not want a method to return something.
--> String is used to return a string value.
--> int is used to return an integer value.

->Main method is the start of execution from where the program begins. 

#3
The syntax for method:-
class Computer
{
	public void playMusic()
	{
		System.out.println("Music Playing..");
	}
}
