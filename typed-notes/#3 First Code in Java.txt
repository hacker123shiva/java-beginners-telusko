In this lecture we will learn:
- Using the VsCode IDE
- How to start VsCode?
- How do we create a project?
- Creating the first java code
- Use of JShell to run small codes
- Steps to compile a code in the terminal

#1
We will start doing coding in the VsCode.
- VsCode includes Explorer, Search, Run and Debug, and Add Extension options in it.
- You can add an extension if you want as per the VsCode recommendation like Extension Pack for Java.
- We will create a project in Explorer.
- VsCode itself has a terminal where you can run commands.
	java --version  -> used to check the version of java
	javac --version -> used to check the version of java compiler
- java command is used to run the code while the javac command is used to compile the code.

-> How do we create a project?
Project is a very broad term that is used when we create some files and merge these files with libraries. 
- We will create a new folder where we store all the files of our course.

-> Creating a first Java file:
-You can create the first java file in a folder like Hello.java.
- .java is an extension of Java files.

#2
Creating our first Java Code to print "Hello World" :
JShell:-
- We have a concept of JShell that is introduced in Java 9 where you can create small codes and perform operations.
- Print is an inbuilt method in Java that is used to print anything and it uses with System.out like:
	System.out.print(6);
	System.out.print("hello world");       
- double quotes are used to print any text.
- a semicolon is required after every statement in Java as per the syntax.
-JShell can't be used for doing projects, it is only useful for experiments or learning concepts.

Two steps to compile any code:
1. Compile the code using the javac command.
	javac filename
2. Run the code using the java command.
	java classname
