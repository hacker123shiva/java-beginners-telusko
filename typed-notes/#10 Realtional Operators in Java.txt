In this lecture we will learn:
- Relational Operators in Java
- Types of Relational Operators
- The return type of relational operations

Relational operators are used where we need to compare things. 
- We can use less than, greater than or also compare two values like they are equal or not.
- In Java, equal to (=) is an assignment operator that is used to assign values.
 x=5   ( here, we are assigning the value 5 to the variable x).
- Double equal to (==) is used to compare two values.
- If we have to check the values are not equal, then we use not equal to an operator (!=). 

Relational Operators:-
less than (<)
greater than (>)
equal to for comparison (==)
not equal to (!=)
less than equal to (<=)
greater than equal to (>=)

-> Relational operators return a boolean result after the comparison.
-> They are mostly used in looping and conditional statements.
