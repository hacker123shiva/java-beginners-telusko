In this lecture we will learn:
- Parameters of a method
- Method overloading in Java
- When does method overloading happen?
- Different ways of method overloading in Java

#1
It is not compulsory that a class should have methods and variables. It will be empty also.
- The parameters that except the values in a method should be equal to the parameters that we pass in a method to call it.
- As it might create a problem if the parameters excepted by the method are not equal to the number of values passed.
- So, to overcome this problem we do overloading.
- As we can have two methods we the same name but different parameters.
- Either the number of parameters or the type of parameters should be different.
- Method with the same name and parameters but with different return types will also not work. The return type does not matter here. Method name and parameters matter only.

#2
Method overloading:- In Java, there can be more than one method with the same name but the number of parameters or type of parameters should be different.

- Method overloading is also known as Compile-time Polymorphism, Static Polymorphism, or Early binding in Java.
- In Method overloading compared to parent argument, child argument will get the highest priority.

#3
Different ways of Method Overloading in Java:-
1. Changing the number of parameters
-> Method overloading can be achieved by changing the number of parameters while passing to different methods.

2. Changing Data Types of the Arguments
-> If methods have the same name but have different parameter types then also methods are considered as overloaded.

3. Changing the Order of the Parameters of Methods
-> By rearranging the parameters of two or more overloaded methods.
