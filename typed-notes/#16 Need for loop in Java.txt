In this lecture we will learn:
- What are loops in Java?
- Different kinds of loops
- Need for loops in Java

#1
Loops in Java is a feature used to execute a particular part of the program repeatedly if a given condition evaluates to be true.
- We use loops, when we have to execute a same statement multiple times.
- In Java, we have different types of loops:-
1. while loop
2. do while loop
3. for loop 
- Different type of loops have different kind of use- cases like a finite number of times or based on some condition.

#2
Need of loops in Java:-
- It reduce the size of the code.
- Loops make an easy flow of the control.
- Loops reduce the time complexity and space complexity.
