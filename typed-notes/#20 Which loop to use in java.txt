In this lecture we will learn:
- Use case of for loop
- Use case of while loop
- Use case of do-while loop

For loop:-
If you know how many iterations you want to go for loop
(intiliazing vaue, condition, increment or decrement)
- Most of the times for loop is used.

While loop:-
When you need to read the file go for while loop, if the number of iterations is not known.
- While loop will be used mostly when we want to read a file or read a database.

-> For loop can also be used as a while.
 
Do While Loop:-
If you condition get false but you want to exceute the code at least once.
- It will runs one for sure whether the condition is true or false.
