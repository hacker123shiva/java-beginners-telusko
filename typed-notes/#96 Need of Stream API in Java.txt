In this lecture we will learn:
- What is Stream API?
- Method in a stream interface
- Difference between normal and enhanced for loop
- forEach method in a list interface


#1
- Stream API is the concept introduced in Java 1.8 version.
- The Stream API is used to process collections of objects. 
- Stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods to produce the desired result.
- asList() is a method that gives a list that belongs to a class array.
	List<Integer> nums = Arrays.asList(4,5,7,2,6,3);
- Stream is an interface that belongs to java.lang package.
- Stream interface provides a lot of methods like filter(), map(), reduce(), etc.
- A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from Collections like arrays.

#2
- Normal for loop iterates over the elements one by one whereas enhanced for loop array itself give a value and that value goes into a variable say n.
- We can also print all the values present in an array by using the forEach method(). 
- forEach method gives one value at a time and we can save that value in a variable say n and print it.
	nums.forEach( n-> System.out.println(n));
- forEach method is part of a list interface, that gives one value at a time and then you can perform operations on it.
