In this lecture we will learn:
- Types of constructors in Java
- What are Parameterized constructors?
- What are default constructors?

A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. 

Parameterized Constructor:-
- A constructor that takes some parameters is known as parameterized constructor.
- The parameterized constructor is used to provide different values to different objects.

Default Constructor:-
- A normal constructor is known as the default constructor.
- If you do not create any constructor, then java creates a default constructor. That constructor will be blank with no parameters.
- The default constructor is used to provide the default values to the object like 0, null, etc., depending on the type.

->The default constructor can change into the parameterized constructor. But Parameterized constructor canâ€™t change into the default constructor.
