In this lecture we will learn:
- While loop in Java
- When to use the while loop?
- Syntax of while loop
- Nested loops

Loops can be used when we have to repeat something.

#1
While loop:-
- While loop is used with a condition. We need to provide a condition inside the while loop.
- If we will give the condition as true inside the while loop then it will infinite times.
-If we do not provide any condition inside the while loop then it is known as an empty loop.
- We require an iterator inside the loop to execute the statements.
--> We use plus opertaor(+) for concatenation. When we have to concatenate or join two things, we simply use plus operator.
- We need to put the condition inside the while loop for executing statements. We run the loop until the condition gets false.
- When the condition inside the while loops get false, then after that it will not execute the statement of the block and the iterator directly jumps out of the block.

- The while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown but the terminating condition is known.
-  While loop is also an entry-controlled loop as the condition is checked before entering the loop. The test condition is checked first and then the control goes inside the loop.

Syntax of while loop:-
	while(condition)
	{
		statements;
	}

#2
Nested loops:-
- We can also use a loop inside another loop statement. A loop inside another loop is known as a nested loop.
- There can be any number of inner loops inside an outer loop.
