In this lecture we will see:
- Instance variable and Local variable
- Can we declare two or more variables with the same name?
- This keyword and its uses in Java


#1
Instance variable:- These variables are declared within a class but outside a method.
- These variables are created when we create an object and are destroyed when the object is destroyed.

Local variable:- These variables are declared within a method but do not get any default value.
- They are created when we enter a method or constructor and get destroyed when the call returns from the method.


#2
In Java, it is not allowed to declare two or more variables having the same name inside a scope either in class scope or method scope.
- The preference is always given to the local variable.
- Creating an object is not a good idea to solve the issue of conflicting names of instance and local variables.
- We can differentiate between local and instance variables by passing an object itself.
- Instead of writing and passing an object, we can simply use this keyword.


#3
This keyword:-
This keyword represents the current object.
- Current object is an object which is calling the method.
- This keyword is used to invoke the current class constructor.
- Using the 'this' keyword, we can return the current class instance.
-  This keyword can be used as an argument in the constructor call.
