In this lecture we will see:
- What are constructors in Java/
- Properties and use of a constructor
- Syntax of a constructor

#1
- When you create an object then in the heap memory, it will just create a blank object.
- If you do not assign values than the default values will be assigned like:
	0 for int,
	NULL for string
- We can also define values at the time of the creation of an object by giving our default values.

#2
Properties of a constructor:
- Constructor is almost similar to a method it has a name and it also has round brackets.
- The change in the constructor with respect to the method is that in the constructor we do not specify the return type.
- The name of a constructor must be the same as the class name.
- There is no need to call a constructor. It gets called automatically at the time of the creation of an object.
-  At the time of calling the constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory.
- Constructors are called only once at the time of object creation. While method(s) can be called any number of times.

#3
Syntax of a constructor:
class human {
	public Human()
	{
		statements;
	}
}
