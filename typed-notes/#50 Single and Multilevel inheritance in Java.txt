In this lecture we will learn:
- Types of inheritance in Java
- Single inheritance in Java
- Multilevel inheritance in Java
- Examples related to single and multilevel inheritance


Single Inheritance:-
- In single inheritance, subclasses inherit the features of one superclass. 
- Only one parent class exists in single inheritance.
- It is when there are only two classes.
e.g., 
Calc class inherits the properties of AdvCalc class.
Here, Calc -> child class
	    AdvCalc -> parent class


Multi-level inheritance:-
- In Multilevel Inheritance, a derived class will be inheriting a base class, and as well as the derived class also acts as the base class for other classes.
- More than one parent class exists in multilevel inheritance.
- It is when we have multiple layers in between the classes.
e.g.,
Calc class inherits the properties of AdvCalc and further AdvCalc inherits the properties of VeryAdvCalc.
Here, Calc -> child class
	    AdvCalc -> parent class of Calc & child class of VeryAdvCalc
	    VeryAdvCalc -> parent class of both other classes
